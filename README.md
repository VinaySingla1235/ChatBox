> A Realtime Chat Application

A simple realtime chat apoplication made using [React JS](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html), a JavaScript library to make awesome UI by Facebook, [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/docs), [Express JS](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html) and [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/).

This application uses [React JS](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) component oriented UI creation paradigm. All components are written in [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/jsx-in-depth.html) and ES6 style and are
combined to get a single build for production purpose using [Webpack 5](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/).

ES6 `module` creation along with `import /export` is used. [Babel](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-react) is used to _transpile_ all [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/jsx-in-depth.html) code to vanilla JavaScript code. To install all the dependecies `npm` is used.

Back end is implemented using [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/docs), [Express JS](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html) and [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/). [Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas), the _Cloud_ version of [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/) is used. Real time communication is done using [Socket.io](https://www.npmjs.com/package/socket.io).

This is a _responsive web application_ for viewing in both Mobile and Desktop.
